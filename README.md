# 🚫 Death’s Status Dashboard

> *“Building apps that just work.”*  
> HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Node.js | REST APIs

A clean, dark-themed personal status dashboard showcasing live project statuses, recent activity, and what I’m currently building — inspired by [zedruc.net](https://zedruc.net).

## 💼 What This Is

This is my **personal engineering status page** — a minimalist, modern interface that displays:

- ✅ **Project status** (up/down indicators)
- 📦 **Recent commits** and branch info
- 🔗 **GitHub repo links** + live URLs
- 🛠️ **What I’m working on right now**
- ⚙️ **Tech stack badges** (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, REST API)

Perfect for linking in your:
- Twitter / LinkedIn bio
- Portfolio site
- Developer profile
- Team onboarding docs

No backend. No database. Just pure static HTML/CSS/JS — fast, secure, and always online.
